Distance-2 Graph Coloring

This is a term project of Parallel Programming course. It is a group project and detailed information about the implementations are provided in the presentation file. Cuda and OpenMP are used for this project to implement distance-2 graph coloring algorithm.
Their performances are compared on the running time results of different graphs.
